<h1> Lab 4</h1>
<b>[valid 2022-2023]</b>

<p>
<b><font color="red">Starting from this week...</font></b>:

</p><ul>
<li>Use appropriate collections in order to represent data (otherwise: -0.5 points)
</li><li>Use Java Stream API in order to perform aggregate operations on data.
</li></ul>

<p>
<b>The Student-Project Allocation Problem</b><br>
An instance of this problem consists of students and projects. Each student has a list of projects that are admissible. <br>
A matching is a set of pairs <i>(student, project)</i> such that each student is assigned to at most one project and each project is assigned to at most one student.

We consider the problem of creating a maximum cardinality matching between students and projects.
</p><p>
Example: 3 students (S0,S1,S2) and 3 projects (P0,P1,P2).<br>
Projects considered admissible by: S0={P0,P1,P2}, S1={P0,P1}, S2={P0}. <br>
The maximum cardinality matching should be: {S0-P2, S1-P1, S2-P0}.



</p><p>
The main specifications of the application are:
</p><hr>
<p><b>Compulsory</b> (1p)
</p><ul>
<li>Create a Maven project.
</li><li>Create an object-oriented model of the problem. Students and 
projects have names. Make sure the objects of these classes are 
comparable.
</li><li>Create the students and the projects described in the example. Use <i>streams</i> in order to easily create the objects.
</li><li>Put all the students in a <i>LinkedList</i> and print them sorted by their names.
</li><li>Put all the projects in a <i>TreeSet</i> and print them sorted by their names.
</li></ul>

<hr>
<p><b>Homework</b> (2p)
<br>
</p><ul>

<li>Create a class that describes the problem.
</li><li>Using Java Stream API, write a query that display all the 
students that have a number of preferences lower than the average number
 of preferences.
</li><li>Use <a href="https://github.com/DiUS/java-faker">a third-party library</a> in order to generate random fake names for students and projects. 
</li><li>Create a Greedy algorithm in order to solve the problem.
<br>
</li></ul>
  

<hr>
<p><b>Bonus </b> (2p)
<br>
</p><ul>
<li>Implement an algorithm that determines the maximum cardinality matching <br>
 ... or you may use the following libraries in order to solve it:
 <ul>
 <li> <a href="https://jgrapht.org/">JGraphT</a> 
 </li><li> <a href="https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~acf/graph4j/">Graph4J</a> 
 </li></ul>
</li><li>Create a random problem generator (with thousands of objects) 
and test the performance of the implementation (try both libraries). <br>
Compare the results with the ones obtained by the greedy algorithm.
</li><li>Determine a minimum cardinality set formed of students and 
projects with the property that each admissible pair (student-project) 
contains at least an element of this set.
</li><li>Determine a maximum cardinality set of of students and projects
 such that there is no admissible pair (student-project) formed with 
elements of this set.
</li></ul>
