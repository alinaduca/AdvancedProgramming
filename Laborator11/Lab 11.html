<h1> Lab 11</h1>
<b>[valid 2022-2023]</b>

<p>
<b>REST Services</b> <br>

Continue the application created <a href="https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~acf/java/labs/lab_10">at the previous lab</a> integrating the following functionalities:
</p><ul>
<li>Implement REST services needed to comunicate with the server side data (CRUD). 
</li></ul>

<p>
The main specifications of the application are:
</p><hr>
<p><b>Compulsory</b> (1p)

</p><ul>
<li> Create a Spring Boot project that will contain the REST services for comunicating with the server data.
</li><li> Create a REST controller containing a method for:
  <ul> 
  <li> obtaining the list of the registered players, via a HTTP GET request.
  </li></ul>
</li><li>Test your service using the browser and/or <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a>.
</li></ul>


<hr>
<p><b>Homework</b> (2p)
<br>

</p><ul>
<li> Create REST services for:
  <ul> 
  <li> adding a new player, via a HTTP POST request.
  </li><li> modifying the name of a player, via a HTTP PUT request.
  </li><li> deleting a player, via a HTTP DELETE request.
  </li></ul>
</li><li> Create a REST service for obtaining the games that were recorded by the server.
</li><li> Create a simple client application that invokes the services above, using the support offered by Spring Boot.
</li><li> Document your services using <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> or a similar tool.
</li></ul>


<hr>
<p><b>Bonus</b> (2p)
</p><ul>
<!-- <li> Handle the exceptions using a <i>RestControllerAdvice</i>. -->
<li> Write a service that determines a (minimal?) group of players C such that, if they were to leave the game server, 
the remaining players would be divided into two groups A and B such that <code>max(|A|,|B|) &lt; 2n/3</code> (n is the total number of players)
and no player in A has ever played with a player in B.
</li><li> Secure this service using <a href="https://jwt.io/">JSON Web Tokens</a>.
</li><li> Create a simple desktop application that sends multiple 
concurrent invocations to the service, in order to determine how many 
API requests per minute it can handle.<br>
You may also monitor other <a href="https://www.moesif.com/blog/technical/api-metrics/API-Metrics-That-Every-Platform-Team-Should-be-Tracking">performance metrics</a>,
using your own implementation or <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/spring-rest-api-metrics">Spring support</a>.

</li></ul>
