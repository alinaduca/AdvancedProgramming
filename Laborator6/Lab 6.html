<b>Graphical User Interfaces (Swing, JavaFX)</b> <br>
Consider a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_game">positional game</a> played on board containing a number of <i>dots</i> placed on a circle.
Some dots are connected to other dots using <i>lines</i>. Initially, the existing lines are gray (not colored). <br>
Two players take turns coloring any uncolored lines. One player colors 
in one color (red), and the other colors in another color (blue). <br>
</p><ul>
<li> Variant 1:  Each player tries to create a triangle made solely of his color.  The player who succeeds, wins the game.
</li><li> Variant 2:  Each player tries to avoid the creation of a 
triangle made solely of his color.  The player who cannot avoid creating
 such a triangle, loses the game.
</li></ul>
<br>
In order to create a graphical user interface for the game, you may use either Swing or JavaFX. 
<p>
Example of a board:
</p><p>
<img src="Lab%206_files/game.png" width="400" height="300">

</p><p>
The main specifications of the application are:
</p><hr>
<p><b>Compulsory</b> (1p)
</p><p>
Create the following components:
</p><ul>
<li> The <i>main frame</i> of the application.

</li><li> A <i>configuration panel</i> for introducing parameters regarding the number of dots and lines and a button for creating a new game.
The panel must be placed at the <i>top</i> part of the frame. The panel must contain at least one label and one input component.

</li><li> A <i>canvas (drawing panel)</i> for drawing the board. Draw the dots and the lines according to the values specified in the config panel.
This panel must be placed in the <i>center</i> part of the frame.

</li><li> A <i>control panel</i> for managing the game.
This panel will contain the buttons: <i>Load</i>, <i>Save</i>, <i>Exit</i> ,etc. and it will be placed at the <i>bottom</i> part of the frame.
</li></ul>

<hr>
<p><b>Homework</b> (2p)
<br>
</p><ul>
<li> Create the object oriented model of the game. Consider implementing a retained mode for drawing the game board.
</li><li> Implement the logic of the game. Use a <i>mouse listener</i> in order to select the line which must be colored, either by selecting the dots or the line itself.
Validate the moves, according to the game rules. Determine the winner of the game.
</li><li> Export the current image of the game board into a PNG file.
</li><li> Use object serialization in order to save and restore the current status of the game.
</li></ul>


<hr>
<p><b>Bonus</b> (2p)
</p><ul>
<li> Implement a non-trivial AI for the game.
</li><li> Using Graph4J API, implement an efficient algorithm for counting all the triangles in a graph;
see <a href="https://github.com/jgrapht/jgrapht/blob/master/jgrapht-core/src/main/java/org/jgrapht/GraphMetrics.java">GraphMetrics.getNumberOfTriangles</a> in JGraphT.
